* MeshDR
Generate random deformations of meshes for domain randomization. Set parameters to randomly generate thousands of NURB splines and save the resulting deformed mesh STL files.

See =python meshdr/meshdr.py --help=

* Examples
All mesh deformations are randomly generation with spline offsets normally distributed. Screenshots are of just a single representative deformation out of infinite possibile deformations.
